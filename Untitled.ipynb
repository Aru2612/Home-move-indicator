With the necessary consents, this property could potentially be extended on, and potentially create a plot for more than one home.Tongdean Avenue is located between Tongdean Road and Woodruff Avenue, this house being towards the Tongdean Road end. It is considered one of the most desirable roads due to the plot sizes and the detached feeling of city living, whilst still not being too far from it.D\",\n",

Set slightly back from the road, the house is rendered in a lovely contemporary ecru finish with feature walls clad in stone tiles. Accessed via a private drive and electric gates, the home has a welcoming entrance with a striking open wooden porch. Large windows throughout flood the interiors with natural light, complementing the bright, neutral finish. Inside the house is enhanced by an array of technical additions, such as under floor heating, attractive down lighters, built-in speaker system and wifi able appliances. A dramatic entrance hall features stone tiled flooring and a stunning staircase constructed from wood and glass; indeed wood and natural materials feature prominently throughout the house, with doors and lintels, flooring and decking hewn from different woods. From the entrance hall two sets of doors lead onto the principal reception rooms: To one side the expansive sitting room, with the kitchen/dining room opposite. Providing extensive entertainment space, the living room acts as a 'hub' of the home, with almost full-width bi-fold doors bringing the outside in. When fully folded back, the sitting room opens onto the lovely patio area creating an 'indoor outdoor' space. The kitchen/dining room is equally spacious; designed as one open plan room, there is plenty of space for a dining table with the addition of an attractive Dekton island and work surfaces, with a raised breakfast bar affording additional seating space. The kitchen has a wealth of cabinet space, both wall- and floor-mounted in a modern monochrome style, with a range of integrated appliances including four ovens and instant boiling tap water. A utility room on the lower ground floor provides additional space for white goods. Also on the lower ground floor is a well-proportioned family/cinema room, with a recessed alcove for a television or projector and a bedroom with en suite bathroom, ideal as a guest suite.Upstairs, three beautifully appointed bedrooms feature plush carpets and built-in wardrobes with lots of hanging space; two have lovely Juliet balconies and en suite bathrooms. The master bedroom is a wonderfully relaxing space with its own dressing room. All bathrooms are finished to a very high standard with clever use of lighting and good-looking quality fixtures; the master bedroom's en suite in particular incorporates a striking freestanding bath tub into a luxurious marble scheme.SituationThe house is located on a quiet private road amid the many amenities of Hove, with Brighton city centre and the seafront just two miles away. Excellent commuter links can be reached via the convenient thoroughfare of Dyke Road just 0.2 miles away at the end of Hove Park Road, affording access to the A27, A23 and Gatwick Airport. Green areas are also readily accessible, with Hove Recreation Ground and Hove Park moments away, Hove Lawns on the seafront and the South Downs a short drive away via Dyke Road.

       "   'description': \"Set over five separate levels this Georgian house gracefully disguises an abundance of space in fine style.Being only a short walk north from the seafront and merely down from Western Road -which proves brimming with exciting shopping and dining opportunities- you couldn't ask for a better mix of desirable lifestyles.The house is currently arranged as two, one bedroom apartments on the ground and lower ground floors, with the first floor and above a separate three bedroom apartment.Before entering, you notice this town house stands out amongst the other properties especially with the ornamental and decorative, bright plantation along your balcony. Upon entering your front door your wide set sweeping staircase awaits ahead to lead you up to your home.The upper floors include modern country-house style kitchen merged with a breakfast area, fitted perfectly with cupboards and all modern appliances including a Rangemaster oven. Which match beautifully with the checker board tiled flooring. Leading through is a separate, formal dining room decorated in keeping with the Royal Pavilion. A miraculous oriental appeal to this space includes unique ceiling art, a marbled fireplace with mirror and window-framing with vivid imagery.To the front is the bow-fronted sitting room, a large space with a regal décor. This is illuminated by natural light flooding through the floor-to\\xad ceiling sash windows that give you easy access to the balcony with a view on the local parish church and the beach. Striking features such as a functioning Art Nouveau cast-iron stove in front of a marble mantelpiece, gold cornicing and intricate ceiling carving are nothing less than impressive. The grand feel is finished with sublime furnishings like the detailed curtain pelmets, period wallpapers and lightingOn the second floor you find a brilliantly sized second bedroom, which is currently used as a further reception space / library, with an oblique sea-view. Bedroom three makes for a perfect guest bedroom or personal office. This level also encompasses a checker-board tiled second bathroom and a utility room.Scaling up once again, you have the third floor dedicated to the master suite. With copious amounts of space for pleasure and storage as well as oozing such distinct character, there is nothing left to be desired. The master bedroom has free views over the roof tops of buildings across the street. The en suite is utterly unique, with an authentic Victorian bathroom suite on classically patterned dry-pressed vitrified tiles.A spacious well-lit loft provides perfect storage space. Your private, south-west facing roof terrace can also be accessed from here, with more than enough room to host an intimate evening of 'al fresco' dining or enjoy quietly soaking up the sun throughout the day. This outside space is a real treasure in central Brighton.The ground and lower ground floor apartments are currently let out on an ast contract. Both apartments have been well maintained and can continue on their ast contracts if the new buyer wishes.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Description  'The House' on Yorklands is a great family home in a wonderful position that we know buyers will fall in love with. Located off one of the most desirable roads in Hove, it is also just a short drive to the A23/A27. Brighton or Hove stations are nearby with direct trains to London Bridge and London Victoria.The ground floor accommodation is spacious and flows really well. The entrance hall is the perfect welcome, with the living room having large windows overlooking the front and double doors leading to the rear garden, both of which allowing plenty of light to flood in. Open plan from the sitting room is the family room which the current owners use as a television room. The kitchen is spacious and has duel aspect windows overlooking the garden, it has plenty of room for a table and chairs and double doors that lead out to the patio area of the garden. The dining room leads off the kitchen and is a great size and is a fantastic space for entertaining guests. Importantly, there is a utility room between the kitchen and dining room which also has access to the garden.On the first floor there are five bedrooms and the family bathroom leading off the impressive galleried landing. The master bedroom is one of our favourite rooms in the home, it is a huge space with a large en-suite as well as excellent storage. Bedroom two is a large double bedroom with en-suite and fitted storage and the third bedroom is spacious and has stunning far reaching views of Hove and the sea.Outside, leading from either the kitchen or living room the large south facing rear garden is mainly laid to lawn and has a large patio directly to the rear of the house which is ideal for barbecues in the summer sun. The garden wraps around the entire house which means there is always some outside space in the sun.What we love most about this wonderful house is the feeling of being out in the secluded countryside even though you are less than 10 minutes to the centre of Brighton and Hove. A truly special home.Location  Yorklands is arguably in one of the best locations in Hove, set far back from Dyke Road Avenue along a private road that only accesses three individual detached houses, it is just a short journey from the centre of the city but within easy access to the A23 and A27. If you prefer to ride the bus into town, to avoid trying to park, there is a bus stop a short walk away giving direct access to the city.\",\n",

Upon entering your front door your wide set sweeping staircase awaits ahead to lead you up to your home.The upper floors include modern country-house style kitchen merged with a breakfast area, fitted perfectly with cupboards and all modern appliances including a Rangemaster oven. Which match beautifully with the checker board tiled flooring. Leading through is a separate, formal dining room decorated in keeping with the Royal Pavilion. A miraculous oriental appeal to this space includes unique ceiling art, a marbled fireplace with mirror and window-framing with vivid imagery.To the front is the bow-fronted sitting room, a large space with a regal décor. This is illuminated by natural light flooding through the floor-to\\xad ceiling sash windows that give you easy access to the balcony with a view on the local parish church and the beach. Striking features such as a functioning Art Nouveau cast-iron stove in front of a marble mantelpiece, gold cornicing and intricate ceiling carving are nothing less than impressive. The grand feel is finished with sublime furnishings like the detailed curtain pelmets, period wallpapers and lightingOn the second floor you find a brilliantly sized second bedroom, which is currently used as a further reception space / library, with an oblique sea-view. Bedroom three makes for a perfect guest bedroom or personal office. This level also encompasses a checker-board tiled second bathroom and a utility room.Scaling up once again, you have the third floor dedicated to the master suite. With copious amounts of space for pleasure and storage as well as oozing such distinct character, there is nothing left to be desired. The master bedroom has free views over the roof tops of buildings across the street. The en suite is utterly unique, with an authentic Victorian bathroom suite on classically patterned dry-pressed vitrified tiles.A spacious well-lit loft provides perfect storage space. Your private, south-west facing roof terrace can also be accessed from here, with more than enough room to host an intimate evening of 'al fresco' dining or enjoy quietly soaking up the sun throughout the day. This outside space is a real treasure in central Brighton.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Located on a traditional working mews a short walk from Hove station is this substantial mixed-use property, comprising a beautifully renovated three-bedroom maisonette and ground-floor workspace with B1 designation. Originally built in the 1880s as stables for the Regency properties of Cromwell Road, the property extends to over 2,200 sq ft internally, and is arranged over three floors, retaining at its rear a wonderful glazed vinery, formerly used as a Peach house.The property is the largest mews house on the street and represents an exciting project with the potential for further renovation as a live / work space, or for full conversion to residential, subject to the relevant approval.Entry from the granite-cobbled mews is through enormous wooden shutters to the double-fronted ground-floor studio. The large open space consists of a part-insulated brick-built shell with concrete flooring and ceilings that rise to over three metres. At the rear, through an open doorway, is a further room with double barrel-vaulted ceiling and original glass-brick windows. Between the two areas is an original Victorian light well, flooding the centre of the building with natural light. An internal staircase ascends to the upper levels, also accessible via a stone staircase to the right, allowing for the two units to be used independently.On the first floor is an open-plan kitchen and living room with sash windows, stripped wood flooring and a working fireplace. The kitchen, has timber worktops and is set behind a glazed partition. On this level is also a tiled shower room with walk-in shower and a double bedroom which steps down into a fantastic Grade-ii listed vinery with voluminous double-glazed cathedral ceilings.The second floor has two bedrooms, both with roof lights. The larger of the two is divided by a glazed partition creating a separate area currently used as a study. The recent renovation includes new electrics, plumbing and insulation through the upper levels.Cambridge Grove is located within the Willett Estate Conservation Area. The mews is a private road consisting of commercial and residential units, with businesses ranging from mechanics and offices, to creative studios and a coffee roastery that offers discounted coffee for residents. There are a number young families along the mews which is increasingly popular among artists and designers, and the community holds regular street parties.There are two superb shopping streets nearby – Portland Road and Richardson Road – which offer a wide range of boutiques, specialist food shops and general stores. There are several good pubs and cafes in the area and of course, the beach at Hove (approximately ten minutes on foot).Trains from Hove, or buses, take you directly and quickly into central Brighton which is well known for its variety and quality of shopping, dining and cultural opportunities. Trains run from Brighton to London Victoria in just 51 minutes (with slightly longer services running from Hove), and the A23 is approximately seven minutes by car.',\n",

Integral garage, gas central heating throughout and newly fitted double glazed conservation windows throughout the property. The exterior has undergone a total repaint including all 5 houses within the courtyard. All 5 houses benefit from new conservation windows. The property also benefits from a door access system and house alarm. This is a unique opportunity to own a town house with garage and patio in central Hove.Internal inspection is strongly recommended to fully appreciate this property's locality, presentation and many features.Even though this has just been decorated, you have the option as a variation to contract to have the rooms painted in your choice of colour before you move in. This can easily be arranged.Local AreaTucked away in a modern mews style setting in the Brunswick conservation area, the house has the rare privilege for off road parking, its own integral garage and is quite literally within just a hundred yards of the seafront, right on the very doorstep and within just a short walk of the area's huge variety of restaurants, bars and coffee shops.Vendor says - i've lived here for 14 years and it is rare to find such a lovely home in central Hove that has a private courtyard, garage and garden patio only 30 paces to view the sea. I purchased it from my friend who owned it from new approximately 20 years ago. This is a great house for entertaining, especially from spring to late autumn as the kitchen by-fold doors open to the patio giving you great social living and entertainment space. I spend most of the time in the kitchen and patio as you are not overlooked. The sun sets behind Adelaide Crescent late into the evening so a great suntrap all afternoon. Great at night with the patio/planter lighting on. Need I say more! I will really miss the centrality of this house and its proximity to absolutely everything, along with the local community and my genuinely great neighbours. I will miss the Café/bar life style here in central Hove. Even though this has just been decorated, you have the option as a variation to contract to have the rooms painted in your choice of colour before you move in.
